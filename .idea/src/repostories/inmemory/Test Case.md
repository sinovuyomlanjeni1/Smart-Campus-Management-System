## ðŸ§ª Test Cases â€” Verifying CRUD Operations

The unit tests ensure that the `InMemoryUserAccountRepository` correctly handles **CRUD** operations as follows:

| Operation | Test Method | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Create/Save** | `testSaveAndFindById()` | Saves a `UserAccount` entity and verifies it can be retrieved by ID. |
| **Read/Find** | `testSaveAndFindById()` | After saving, `findById()` successfully locates the correct entity. |
| **Read All** | `testFindAll()` | After saving multiple users, `findAll()` returns the full list of stored entities. |
| **Delete** | `testDelete()` | Deletes a user by ID and verifies that `findById()` no longer finds the user. |

---

### ðŸ›  JUnit 5 Test Coverage
- Tested **positive flows** (saving and retrieving existing users).
- Tested **negative flows** (retrieving after deletion to confirm it's missing).
- Used `Optional` to handle cases where the entity may or may not exist.

âœ… These tests validate that the **In-Memory Repository** behaves correctly for all basic persistence operations.

âœ… Ensures robustness before integrating real database storage in future development.
