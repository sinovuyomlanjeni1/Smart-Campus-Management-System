# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?
A **Kanban board** is a visual project management tool that helps teams track work in progress. It consists of columns representing different workflow stages, where tasks move from left to right as they progress.

## How Our Kanban Board Works
### **Workflow Visualization**
- Columns: **Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Done**
- Tasks (GitHub Issues) move through these stages, providing a clear view of project progress.

### **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**
- WIP limits prevent bottlenecks and improve efficiency.
- Example: No more than **3 tasks in ‘In Progress’** to ensure focused work.

### **Supporting Agile Principles**
- **Continuous Delivery:** Tasks are tracked in real-time, ensuring a steady workflow.
- **Adaptability:** Tasks can be reprioritized based on project needs.
- **Collaboration:** Issues are assigned using `@mentions`, improving communication.

By using Kanban, we streamline task management, improve team efficiency, and ensure Agile best practices.
