# Product Backlog

## Overview
This backlog prioritizes user stories using the **MoSCoW method** and includes effort estimates (story points).

| Story ID | User Story | Priority (MoSCoW) | Effort Estimate (Story Points) | Dependencies |
|----------|-----------|------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| US-001 | As a student, I want to check my attendance records so that I can track my participation. | Must-have | 3 | None |
| US-002 | As a lecturer, I want to mark student attendance so that I can track class participation. | Must-have | 5 | US-001 |
| US-003 | As a parent, I want to view my child's attendance report so that I can monitor their progress. | Should-have | 3 | US-001 |
| US-004 | As a lecturer, I want to edit the class timetable so that I can manage schedule changes. | Must-have | 4 | None |
| US-005 | As a student, I want to receive notifications about class schedule updates so that I can stay informed. | Must-have | 3 | US-004 |
| US-006 | As an admin, I want to generate reports on student attendance so that I can analyze trends. | Should-have | 4 | US-002 |
| US-007 | As an IT staff member, I want user data encrypted with AES-256 so that security compliance is maintained. | Must-have | 5 | None |
| US-008 | As a student, I want to book campus facilities so that I can reserve study rooms and labs. | Could-have | 3 | None |

## Justification of Prioritization
- **Must-have stories** align with stakeholder needs for usability, security, and core system functionality.
- **Should-have stories** enhance user experience but are not critical for MVP.
- **Could-have stories** provide additional value but can be deferred.
