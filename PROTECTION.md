# PROTECTION.md

## 🔐 Branch Protection Justification

Protecting the `main` branch ensures that:
- 🚫 No broken or untested code is merged directly.
- ✅ All code changes are peer-reviewed.
- ✅ All tests pass before integration (via CI).
- 🔄 Changes must go through Pull Requests, promoting team collaboration.

This setup reflects real-world DevOps standards, minimizing bugs and increasing deployment reliability.
