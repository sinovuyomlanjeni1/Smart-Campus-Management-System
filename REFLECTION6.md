# Reflection: Challenges in Agile Planning, Prioritization, and Estimation

## 1. Prioritization Challenges
One of the biggest challenges in Agile planning was deciding which user stories should be implemented first. Using the **MoSCoW** prioritization method helped, but there were trade-offs:
- **High-priority security features (AES-256 encryption)** needed early implementation, but they did not provide immediate user value.
- **User-facing features (attendance tracking, notifications)** were prioritized to enhance early adoption.
- **Stakeholder expectations** required balancing between usability and system performance.

## 2. Effort Estimation Difficulties
Estimating story points was complex because:
- Some tasks (e.g., **attendance API development**) had **uncertain technical complexity**.
- Dependencies between tasks (e.g., **notification system needing timetable updates**) created estimation uncertainty.
- The **Fibonacci sequence** for effort estimation provided a general framework, but real-world implementation needed adjustments.

## 3. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs
As the sole stakeholder at this point, self-imposed **internal resistance** emerged in:
- **Balancing speed vs. quality**—Should we rush MVP delivery or ensure long-term maintainability?
- **Shifting requirements**—New ideas constantly emerged, making backlog refinement necessary.
- **Testing priorities**—Choosing between functional testing (attendance tracking) and non-functional testing (performance, security).

## 4. Key Takeaways
- **Iteration is key:** The backlog and sprint plan will need refinement as real implementation begins.
- **Agile is adaptable:** Not all features need to be perfect in the first sprint—incremental delivery is crucial.
- **Trade-offs are necessary:** Prioritizing core functionality over enhancements ensures a strong foundation for future sprints.
