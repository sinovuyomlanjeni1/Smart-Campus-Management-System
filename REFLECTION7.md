# Reflection on GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template
1. **Template Selection**: Choosing the right template required evaluating features, automation, and alignment with Agile.
2. **Customization Complexity**: Adding new columns and linking issues required additional setup and planning.
3. **Task Assignment & Workflow Management**: Ensuring issues were correctly labeled and assigned to the right team members.

## Comparing GitHubâ€™s Kanban with Other Tools

| Tool         | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **GitHub Kanban** | Directly integrates with GitHub Issues and repositories, automates workflows | Limited flexibility in UI customization |
| **Trello** | Intuitive UI, customizable boards, simple drag-and-drop | Lacks deep GitHub integration, no built-in automation |
| **Jira** | Powerful for large teams, advanced reporting, Agile-focused | Steeper learning curve, complex setup |

## Lessons Learned
- **GitHub Kanban is best for developers** due to deep GitHub integration.
- **Trello is great for simple task management** but lacks automation.
- **Jira is powerful but may be overkill** for small projects.

### Final Thoughts
Using GitHub Kanban improved workflow visualization, issue tracking, and team collaboration, making it a valuable Agile project management tool.
